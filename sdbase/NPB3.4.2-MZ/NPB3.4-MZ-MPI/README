This is the hybrid MPI+OpenMP implementation of the multi-zone
NAS Parallel Benchmarks.  For detail descriptions of the benchmarks,
please see:

   nas-03-010-abstract.html


For benchmark compilation and runtime setup, please refer to
README.install included in the directory.

This file briefly summarizes features and changes made in
different releases of the hybrid versions.


NPB 3.4.2-MZ-MPI

This is a bug-fix release.
  * LU-MZ: fixed a bug in setting up proc_num_threads when
    the x-dimension partition is involved for runs that use
    more than 16 (number of zones) MPI ranks.


NPB 3.4.1-MZ-MPI

This is a minor release with no functional change.

  * Changed Fortran sources from fixed form to free form

  * Included a few "dummy" MPI routines to support compilation and 
    linking without an MPI library.  This is intended for testing
    runs with OpenMP only.  See README.install for details.


NPB 3.4-MZ-MPI

  * Use Fortran 90 ALLOCATE for dynamic memory allocation.
    It is no longer needed to compile for each process count.
    Use Fortran modules for global data (to replace common blocks).

  * Improvement on the OpenMP parallelization with the use of
    the COLLAPSE clause for multiple loop nests in BT-MZ and SP-MZ.

  * Domain decomposition has been applied to the I dimension of zones
    besides the zone dimension for LU-MZ to improve the MPI scalability
    of this code.  This change requires the MPI library to support
    MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE when the code is running in the hybrid mode.

  * Support for specifying the number of threads for each rank from
    environment variables when NPB_MZ_BLOAD is set to "ERANK".
    Support for process range specification in load data file.

  * Use Fortran 2003 IEEE arithmetic function to catch the NaN condition
    during verification.

  * The environment variable NPB_TIMER_FLAG is now used to enable 
    additional timers.  This method supersedes the use of the file
    "timer.flag" in the working directory.


NPB 3.3.1-MZ-MPI

  * Fixed a missing argument bug in calling MPI_Abort().

  * Implemented a simple block distribution of zones to MPI processes
    in SP-MZ and LU-MZ.  This might improve performance of the two 
    benchmarks in some cases.


NPB 3.3-MZ-MPI

  * Merged vector codes into the release.  The vector version
    can be selected with VERSION=VEC during compilation.

  * Improved cache performance for the SP-MZ benchmark

  * Minor bug fix in mpi_setup.f for mismatched arguments


NPB 3.2-MZ-MPI

  * Introduced two new classes of problem: E and F

  * Added "SCHEDULE(STATIC)" to the OpenMP layer of hybrid versions

  * Minor optimization to the communication buffers in MPI versions

  * Fixed a data flush bug for pipeline in LU-MZ


NPB 3.1-MZ-MPI

  * Allow variable number of threads for individual processes and 
    define processor group for each process.

  * Report total number of threads (instead of threads-per-process). 

  * Use accurate surface term in MFLOPS calculation to take into 
    account non-square zone faces.

  * Improvements for LU-MZ:
      - Added one SSOR iteraction before timing loop to touch data 
        pages and code section.
      - Improved the memory usage for array 'tv'
      - Made rhs and erhs more cache-friendly.

  * Print built-in timers for all processes
