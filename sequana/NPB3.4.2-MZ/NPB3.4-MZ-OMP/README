NPB3.4.2-MZ (Multi-Zone) OpenMP Versions
-------------------------------------------

This is the nested OpenMP implementation of the multi-zone
NAS Parallel Benchmarks.  For detail descriptions of the benchmarks,
please see:

   nas-03-010-abstract.html


This file briefly summarizes features and changes made in
different releases of the OpenMP versions.  For release history 
of the multi-zone benchmarks, please refer to Changes.log.

For benchmark compilation and runtime setup, please refer to
README.install included in the directory.


NPB 3.4.2-MZ-OMP

No change from previous OMP version.


NPB 3.4.1-MZ-OMP

This is a minor release with no functional change.

  * Changed Fortran sources from fixed form to free form.

  * Update in documentation (README.install).


NPB 3.4-MZ-OMP

  * Use Fortran modules and allocatable arrays to define and manage
    global data (to replace common blocks).  Use Fortran 2003 IEEE 
    arithmetic function to catch the NaN condition during verification.

    Because of these changes, "F77" in all makefiles (including make.def)
    is renamed to "FC" for Fortran compiler.

  * Use of the "COLLAPSE" clause to improve parallelism for OpenMP.
    This requires a compiler that supports OpenMP 3.0.

  * Selection of nested parallelism is now controlled by specifying
    multiple values to the environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS.
    (Use of OMP_NUM_THREADS2 is removed.)

  * Reduced dimension for working arrays (lhs,lhsp,lhsm) to improve 
    cache performance in SP-MZ

  * Minor cache optimization for RHS in LU-MZ

  * The environment variable NPB_TIMER_FLAG is now used to enable 
    additional timers.


NPB 3.3-MZ-OMP

This version is the first release of the nested OpenMP 
implementation of the multi-zone benchmarks.  It replaces
the SMP+OpenMP implementation included in previous releases.
This release is merged with the vector codes.  The vector version 
can be selected with the "VERSION=VEC" option during compilation.
For other details, please refer to README.install.
